======================= 01 What is DHCP snooping and how to configure it? =====================

When DHCP Snooping is enabled, DHCP Server responses are dropped if they donâ€™t arrive on a trusted port.

> When you enable DHCP snooping, the switch inspects the DHCP traffic and keeps track of which IP addresses were assigned to which MAC addresses
For example, PC1 with MAC address 1.1.1 was assigned IP address 10.10.10
> If invalid ARP traffic tries to pass through the switch, for example 3.3.3 saying it is 10.10.10, the switch drops the traffic

SW1(config)#ip dhcp snooping 
SW1(config)#ip dhcp snooping vlan 10 
SW1(config)#int f0/1 
SW1(config-if)#ip dhcp snooping trust
