============================== 01: What/Why is EtherChannel? =======================

EtherChannel is multiple physical switch interfaces, bundled together, behaving for all intents and purposes as one logical interface. 

So what is necessary to pull this off? 
Simply, you run more connections between your existing physical devices, and then configure those interfaces to appear as a single interface.
So you don’t have to buy more equipment, just the cabling. In the world of STP, this new interface looks like only one interface. 

Now in the real world, all of the physical ports are active, forwarding traffic, but due to the algorithms and device behavior, 
it doesn’t introduce loops when correctly configured. 

From the routing protocols perspective, it looks like one high-speed path between the devices,
so the routing protocol would choose to use it. In the real world, when the routing protocol sends traffic over the bundle, 
the traffic is spread across all the physical ports. And here is maybe the best part. In the world of redundancy, 
if at least one of the physical interfaces is still active, the overall Etherchannel appears to be active.
So at that 4 a.m. moment (nothing good happens at 4 a.m.) when a cable or interface stops working, the overall path between your switches is still there!


==========================02. Explain Methode of EtherChannels with  configuration?=====================================

There are 3 methods to configure EtherChannel in your network: the PAgP and LACP negotiating protocols, or Static mode. 
The first step is assigning the physical interfaces to the Etherchannel, with different keywords indicating which protocol is to be used. 
Let’s examine the 3 methods and their differences.

 
STATIC:
-------
A sample static EtherChannel configuration for Figure 1 would be:

SW1(config)#interface range e0/0-1
SW1(config-if-range)#channel-group 1 mode on
SW1(config-if-range)#interface port-channel 1
SW1(config-if)#switchport mode trunk


PAgP(Port-Aggregation Protocol (PAgP)
-------------------------------------

The Port-Aggregation Protocol (PAgP) is Cisco proprietary. It uses the multicast address of
01-00-0C-CC-CC-CC. A sample config for using PAgP for Figure 1 would be:

SW1(config)#interface range e0/0-1
SW1(config-if-range)#channel-group 1 mode (desirable/auto)
SW1(config-if-range)#interface port-channel 1
SW1(config-if)#switchport mode trunk

So if you have auto on both sides, you will never get an Etherchannel. 
You need at least one side using desirable, or both.


LACP(Link Aggregation Control Protocol):
----------------------------------------

LACP is an open protocol
It uses the multicast address of 01-80-c2-00-00-02.

SW1(config)#interface range e0/0-1
SW1(config-if-range)#channel-group 1 mode (active/passive)
SW1(config-if-range)#interface port-channel 1
SW1(config-if)#switchport mode trunk

The active means 'form an Etherchannel'  passive is only responding to requests, not sending any/FORMING.


============================== 04 Are there any bad effect of STP on Layer 3 devices? ==================================
Spanning Tree only runs on Layer 2 interfaces. It will not run on or shut any of the ports down as they are all Layer 3 ports.
The Layer 3 switches’ routing tables will handle path selection, redundancy and load balancing.



===========================05 How to configure interfaces as a Layer 3 Etherchannel with LACP? =========================
Switch1(config)#interface range GigabitEthernet 1/0/1 - 2 
Switch1(config-if-range)#no switchport 
Switch1(config-if-range)#channel-group 1 mode active 
Switch1(config-if-range)#exit

Switch1(config)#interface port-channel 1 
Switch1(config-if)#ip address 192.168.0.1 255.255.255.252 
Switch1(config-if)#no shutdown

Switch2(config)#interface range GigabitEthernet 1/0/1 - 2 
Switch2(config-if-range)#no switchport 
Switch2(config-if-range)#channel-group 1 mode active 
Switch2(config-if-range)#exit

Switch2(config)#interface port-channel 1 
Switch2(config-if)#ip address 192.168.0.2 255.255.255.252 
Switch2(config-if)#no shutdown
