A NETWORK ROUTE is a route that represent a network, not matter if that subnet is /25 or /8, it is still a subnet.
A DEFAULT ROUTE has a higher mask, and the routing table always prefer the most specific route to the host in the routing table.
A HOST ROUTE is used to route traffic to a specific host. The subnet mask in the route will always be all 1's. 
That means the subnet mask for a host route will be /32 for IPv4 and /128 for IPv6.
