--------
A NETWORK ROUTE represents Network, not matter if that subnet is /25 or /8, it is still a subnet.
A DEFAULT ROUTE has a higher mask(0.0.0.0/0 ), and the routing table always prefer the most specific route to the host in the routing table.
A HOST ROUTE is used to route traffic to a specific host. The subnet mask in the route will always be all 1's(10.10.10.10/32 for IPv4 and /128 for IPv6.).

-Provides reliability when loading and ISO image upon boot up                   -Does not require user authenticaiton
-Uses TCP                                                                       -Uses UDP

Input errors: Total of many counters, including all below

b) 172.28.224.1
c) 172.28.228.129




This subnet question requires us to grasp how to subnet very well. 
To quickly find out the subnet range, we have to find out the increment 
and the network address of each subnet. Let's take an example with the subnet 172.28.228.144/18:
From the /18 (= 1100 0000 in the 3rd octet), we find out the increment is 64. Therefore the network address of this subnet must be the greatest multiple of the increment but not greater than the value in the 3rd octet (228). We can find out the 3rd octet of the network address is 192 (because 192 = 64 * 3 and 192 < 228) -
> The network address is 172.28.192.0. So the first usable host should be 172.28.192.1 and it matches with the 5th answer on the right. In this case we don't need to calculate the broadcast address because we found the correct answer.

Let's take another example with subnet 172.28.228.144/23 -> The increment is 2 (as /23 = 1111 1110 in 3rd octet) -> The 3rd octet of the network address is 228
(because 228 is the multiply of 2 and equal to the 3rd octet) -> The network address is 172.28.228.0 -> The first usable host is 172.28.228.1. It is not necessary but if we want to find out the broadcast address of this subnet, we can find out the next network address, which is 172.28.(228 + the increment number).0 or
172.28.230.0 then reduce 1 bit -> 172.28.229.255 is the broadcast address of our subnet. Therefore the last usable host is 172.28.229.254.
