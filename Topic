### Core Topics Covered in CCNA

The CCNA curriculum is divided into six main domains:

1. **Network Fundamentals:**
   * Understanding networking concepts, models (OSI, TCP/IP), network devices (routers, switches, hubs), and basic network topologies.
   * Network addressing (IP addressing, subnetting).

2. **Network Access:**
   * Ethernet technologies, LAN switching, VLANs, and inter-VLAN routing.
   * Network security basics (ACLs, DHCP snooping, dynamic ARP inspection, port security).

3. **IP Connectivity:**
   * IP addressing, routing protocols (RIP, OSPF, EIGRP), routing concepts (static, dynamic routing), and route summarization.

4. **IP Services:**
   * Network Address Translation (NAT), DHCP, DNS, and network troubleshooting.

5. **Security Fundamentals:**
   * Basic security concepts, threats, vulnerabilities, and mitigation techniques.
   * Access control mechanisms (passwords, ACLs, authentication).

6. **Automation and Programmability:**
   * Introduction to network automation and programmability concepts.
   * Understanding the role of APIs and scripting in network management.

### Additional Topics (Depending on Course and Instructor)

While the core topics are standard, some courses might include additional subjects like:
* **Wireless Networking:** Basic concepts of Wi-Fi, wireless standards, and wireless security.
* **Network Troubleshooting:** Advanced troubleshooting techniques and tools.
* **Network Design:** Basic network design principles and considerations.
