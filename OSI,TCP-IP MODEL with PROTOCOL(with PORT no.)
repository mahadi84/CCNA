OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model was created by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), an international standard-setting body. 
TCP/IP model was created in the 1970s by the Defense Advance Research Project Agency (DARPA) as an open, vendor-neutral, public networking model.

OSI                                                                                     USED PROTOCOL                                     TCP/IP

01.APPLICATION  (Service to the User: Ex: Data Access(SEND/RECEIVE))             --------|HTTP, FTP, SMTP, TELNET, SSH, DNS, DHCP, SNMP |
02.PRESENTATION (Encode, encrypt and compress data)                              --------|SSL, TLS                                      | 
03.SESSION (Creates communication channels, called sessions, between devices)    --------|NetBIOS, PAP, PPTP                            | 01.APPLICATION

04.TRANSPORT(Breaks data into “segments”,check if data was received incorrectly) --------|TCP, UDP                                      | 02.TRANSPORT

05.NETWORK (Breaks up segments into network packets and discover best path)      --------|IPv4, IPv6, ARP, ICMP  (IP)                   | 03.INTERNET

06.DATALINK (Establishes physical node connection, 01.LLC- iden. protocol 02.MAC) -------|PPP, HDLC (MAC)                               | 
07.PHYSICAL (Transmit raw data bit(0,1), through physical cable or wireless connection)--|ETHERNET                                      | 04.NETWORK ACCESS


ENCAPSULATION:
--------------
A process of adding headers and trailers to a raw data for sending.

A PDU (protocol data unit) in OSI Model represent a unit of data with headers and trailers for the particular layer, as well as the encapsulated data.
Whereas  TCP/IP model uses terms like segment, packet and frame to refer to a data packet defined by a particular layer. 



===================  PORT and PROTOCOL  =================================

PORT:
-----
A port is a 16-bit number used to identify specific applications and services.
Port numbers are from 0 to 65535. The first 1024 ports are reserved for use by certain privileged services:


Protocols     Ports        Description
---------     ------       -------------
FTP           20/21        File Transfer Protocol. Allows transfer of files between computers/host.
TFTP           69          Trivial File Transfer Protocol.
SSH            22          Secure Shell. Provides a SECURE or unencrypted connection between host systems (for LOGIN/CONFIGURE).
TELNET         23          Provides INSECURE connection to remote computer/hosts  (for LOGIN/CONFIGURE).
HTTP           80          HyperText Transfer Protocol. Allows access to web servers.
HTTPS         443          This is the secure or encrypted version of HTTP. Provides secure access to web servers.
SMTP/SMTPS   25/465        Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. Facilitates delivery of mail. S=Secure
DNS            53          Domain Name System. Resolves domain names to IP addresses.
POP3          110          Post Office Protocol. Allows the download of mail from mail servers.
IMAP          143          Internet Message Access Protocol. It Allows access to mail stored on a mail server.
SNMP          161          Simple Network Management Protocol. Allows you to monitor network devices.
DHCP         67,68         Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), provide automatic IP to host.
SSL           443          SSL encrypts the HTTP traffic at the transport layer, coming from the application layer.
TLS           443          TLS(Transport Layer Security) is a cryptographic protocol that provides end-to-end security of data sent between applications over the Internet.
NetBIOS    137,138,139     Allow applications on separate computers to communicate and establish sessions to access shared resources. Ex:files and printers ovar a LAN.

ARP(Address Resolution Protocol) is a network protocol used to find out the hardware (MAC) address of a device from an IP address. 
                          broadcasts a request packet to all the machines on the LAN and asks if any of the machines are using that particular IP address. 
                          When a machine recognizes the IP address as its own, it sends a reply so ARP can update the cache for future reference and proceed with the communication.
ICMP(Internet Control Message Protocol) – used to detects and reports network error conditions. Used while ping.
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) – a connection-oriented protocol that enables reliable data transfer between two computers.
UDP (User Datagram Protocol) – a connectionless protocol for data transfer. Since a session is not created before the data transfer, there is no guarantee of data delivery.
PAP Password Authentication Protocol
PPTP Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol
HDLC (High-Level Data Link Control) is a bit-oriented protocol that is used for communication over the point-to-point and multipoint links.

Ping (Packet Internet Groper) is the most commonly used tool to troubleshoot a network. 
Ping works by sending an ICMP echo request message to the specified IP address. If the computer with the destination IP address is reachable, 
it responds with an ICMP echo reply message.
It outputs some other information about a network performance, e.g. a round-trip time, a time to send an ICMP request packetand receive an ICMP reply packet.
