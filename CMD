COMMANDs:
---------
01. To configure interface of Router/Switch
02. Add IP/ROUTE to a INTERFACE of Router/Switch
03. RENAME router/switch
04. Show ip for all interfaces in a router/switch
05. Add cost(bandwidth) to a Port AND add auto cost reference bandwidth to a Protocol

06. Load Balance (RIP vs EIGRP vs OSPF)
07. Watch Routing table for RIP/EIGRP/OSPF
08. Watch Neighbor/Adjancencies 
09. Watch Protocol/Database
10. Watch OSPF Interface  
11. All info about OSPF
12. Delete any Routing Protocol and IP from advertise network


ANSWER:

01. router# configure terminal
02. Add IP to a INTERFACE:     #int serial serial/fa/gi 2/0
                                #ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0  
                                #no shutdown
03. Rename Router/Switch:      #hostname router_name
04. Show IP 4 all interfaces   #show IP interface brief 
05. Add cost(bandwidth) to a Port   
                                #int fa 1/1  
                                #ip ospf cost 1500  
    Add auto cost reference bandwidth to Protocol:
                                #router ospf 1 
                                #auto-cost reference-bandwidth 100000 (for 100GB)
06. Load Balance: RIP and OSPF use two or more link with same MATRIC for load balance BUT EIGRP can use link with different matric for load Balance.
07. Watch Routing table:       #show ip route RIP/EIGRP/OSPF
08. Watch Neighbor:            #show ip rip/eigrp/ospf/ neighbour
09. Watch Protocol/database:   #show ip protocols #show ip rip/eigrp/ospf database
10. Watch OSPF Interface:      #show ip ospf interface  OR   #sh ip ospf interface fa 0/0 
11. All info about OSPF:       #show run | section ospf
12. Delete Protocol & Network: #no rip/eigrp/ospf and #no network 10.0.0.2 (with wildcard for eigrp and ospf)
