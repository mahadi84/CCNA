01. What is the alternative if Gatway Router is down?
 =================================================
-If a physical gateway fails, another gateway will take over
-HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol) comes to play
-HSRP is a Cisco proprietary redundancy protocol for establishing a fault-tolerant default gateway.

**In a real world network the core/distribution layer switches would typically be Layer 3 switches
**Iâ€™m using Layer 2 switches in the example to aid learning


02. How does a HSRP works, and Configure it?
============================================

Both routers have a normal physical IP address and MAC address on their HSRP interface. Unique addresses are used on both routers.
They both also have the HSRP virtual IP and MAC address configured on the interface. The same addresses are used on both routers.

When they come online, one is elected the HSRP active router, the other is the standby.
The active router owns the virtual IP and MAC address and responds to ARP requests All traffic for the VIP goes through the active router.

ROUTER 01.
----------
R1(config)#interface g0/1
R1(config-if)#ip address 10.10.10.2 255.255.255.0 
R1(config-if)#no shutdown

ROUTER 02.
----------
R2(config)#interface g0/1
R2(config-if)#ip address 10.10.10.3 255.255.255.0 
R2(config-if)#no shutdown



03. Can I prioritise one router over other and HOW?
===================================================

You can choose which router will be the active by setting priority on the routers
The router with the higher priority will be preferred (default is 100) 
In the event of a tie the highest IP address winsIf pre-emption is also enabled, when a higher priority router comes back 
online after a failure it will transition back to active
If pre-emption is not enabled (default), the lower priority router will remain active when the failed router comes back online
This can be more stable if a higher priority router is flapping

ROUTER 01.
----------
R1(config)#interface g0/1
R1(config-if)#ip address 10.10.10.2 255.255.255.0 
R1(config-if)#no shutdown
R1(config-if)#standby 1 ip 10.10.10.1 
R1(config-if)#standby 1 priority 110 
R1(config-if)#standby 1 preempt

ROUTER 02.
----------
R2(config)#interface g0/1
R2(config-if)#ip address 10.10.10.3 255.255.255.0 
R2(config-if)#no shutdown
R2(config-if)#standby 1 ip 10.10.10.1 
R2(config-if)#standby 1 priority 90


04. Should HSRP version be same?
================================
Yes, HSRP version should be for both router while configur.

05.
========================
a) show standby
