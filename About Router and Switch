What is Cisco ROUTER 2811 ?
--------------------------
The Cisco 2811 is an integrated services router designed by Cisco to support multiple WAN interfaces. 
The Cisco 2811 supports multiple T1 / E1 / xDSL connections and has built in support for over 90 Cisco modules. 
Four high speed WAN slots are available in addition to an enhanced network module slot.

What is a SWITCH 2960?
----------------------
Cisco Catalyst 2960 Series Switches are a family of fixed-configuration, standalone intelligent Ethernet devices with Power Over Ethernet (PoE) 
or non-PoE configurations that provide desktop Fast Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet connectivity, enabling enhanced LAN services 
for entry-level enterprise, midmarket, and branch.


INTERFACE:
----------
There are two type of interface:

01. Parallel Interface:
-----------------------
The Ethernet transmits the data parallel and hence achieves high speed. 
It has a limitation that the Ethernet cannot transmit data over long distances.

02. Serial Interface:
---------------------
To overcome the problem of transmitting data over long distances, serial interfaces are used. Ex: 1841 Router
Serial interfaces can be connected using the cable V.35 DTE and DCE cables.

CLOCK SPEED:
------------
The clock rate serves to synchronize the receiver on the other side of the link.
Each clock pulse signals the transmission of a bit.
Note that it is mainly used in lab setups. In the real world, network providers almost always deliver the clock signal.

Configuration:
router# conf t
router(config)# interface serial 1/0
router(config-if)# clock rate 64000 (represented in BITS per second)
