INTERFACE:
----------
There are two type of interface:

01. Parallel Interface:
-----------------------
The Ethernet transmits the data parallel and hence achieves high speed. 
It has a limitation that the Ethernet cannot transmit data over long distances.

02. Serial Interface:
---------------------
To overcome the problem of transmitting data over long distances, serial interfaces are used. Ex: 1841 Router
Serial interfaces can be connected using the cable V.35 DTE and DCE cables.

CLOCK SPEED:
------------
The clock rate serves to synchronize the receiver on the other side of the link.
Each clock pulse signals the transmission of a bit.
Note that it is mainly used in lab setups. In the real world, network providers almost always deliver the clock signal.

Configuration:
router# conf t
router(config)# interface serial 1/0
router(config-if)# clock rate 64000 (represented in BITS per second)
