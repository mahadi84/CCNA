DYNAMIC ROUTING:
----------------
Dynamic routing protocols, dynamically learn network destinations and how to get to them and also advertise those destinations to other routers. 


ADV of DYNAMIC ROUTING TABLE:
-----------------------------
> Widely used.
> Used in Large network
> No need to configure, routing table update automaticaly.


Type of Dynamic Routing Protocols:
----------------------------------
A)IGP(Interior Gateway Protocol): 
    01) DISTANCE VECTOR (Algorithom Type): 
        -- The routers only learn the 'distance'(metric) and 'vector'(direction, the next-hop router) for each route.
	-- Routers do not have a complete network map of the topology, but only what it has been told by its neighbour aka "routing by rumour".
        -- Only advertise the best route , not every route that is aware of.
	-- Send their entire routing table to directly connected NEIGHBORS.	
	 a> RIP   (Routing Information Protocol)
	 b> EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)
	 
    02) LINK STATE (Algorithom Type): 
       -- Each router creates a independently COMPLETE 'connectivity map' to calculate the best routes to each destination of the network 
        and advertises this information until all neighbors develop the same map of the network.
       -- This protocol shares only the NETWORK TOPOLOGY information instead of advertising the entire routing table.
       -- Link state protocols send information about directly connected links to all the routers in the network.
       -- Faster than Distance Vector protocol but Use more resources(CPU) because more information is shared.
	a> OSPF  (Open Shortest Path First)
	b> IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System)
B)EGP (Exterior Gateway Protocol)
    01) PATH VECTOR (Algorithom Type): Analysis the path to reach the destination to learn if it is loop free or not. 
        a> BGP(Border Gateway Protocol)  


RIP vs OSPF vs IGRP vs EIGRP
----------------------------     
In RIP, networks are not divided into areas or tables.		
Routing with EIGRP is done in Neighbour Tables, Topology tables, and Routing tables.
Routing with OSPF is done in Autonomous System, Areas, Stub Areas and Backbone areas.

RIP-The metrics used Is hop(Maximum hop count is 15, 16 is considered as network unreachable.). -Used in  small to medium-sized networks.	
EIGRP-The metrics used are bandwidth, delay, load and reliability
OSPF-The metrics used are bandwidth and delay.

RIP- Administrative Distance, Default Value is 120.
EIGRP- Administrative Distance, Default Value is EIGRP(summary route)-5, EIGRP(internal)-90, EIGRP(external)-170,
OSPF- Administrative Distance, Default Value is 110

RIP uses Distance vector algorithm to calculate the best path
EIGRP uses Diffusing update algorithm to calculate the best path.
OSPF uses the SPF algorithm to calculate the best path.	






-------------------ROUTING INFORMATION PROTOCOL(RIP)----------------------------------------
                   =================================
-Send routing table's contents and network topology information to each of its adjacent routers every 30 seconds.. 

-When a route is removed from the routing table: 
	>It is flagged as unusable by the receiving routers after 180sec/3min, and 
	>Removed from their tables after an additional 120sec/+2min.

There are two versions of RIP (the managed switch supports both):

01> RIPv1 defined in RFC 1058.
    Routes are specified by IP destination network and hop count.
    The routing table is broadcast to all stations on the attached network.
02>RIPv2 defined in RFC 1723.
   Route specification also includes subnet mask and gateway.
   The routing table is sent to a multicast address, reducing network traffic.
   Authentication is used for security.

CONFIGURATION:
--------------
Tut-Link: https://www.computernetworkingnotes.com/ccna-study-guide/rip-protocol-configuration-guide-with-examples.html

Router(config)#router rip	                (Enable RIP routing protocol)

-------------------------: ENHANCED INTERIOR GATEWAY ROUTING PROTOCOL(EIGRP) :-----------------------------
                           =================================================
			   

EIGRP (DEFINATION and ADVANTAGE):
---------------------------------
1> Most used Dynamic Hybrid Routing Protocol
   -Show both Distance Vector and Link-State Routing Protocol properties.

2> When a change occurs like router up/down, only routing table changes are propagated, not the entire routing table; 
   this reduces the load the routing protocol itself places on the network

3> It keeps the “Backup Routes” beside the “Best Route” to a destination in the Topology table.
   So, during a failure, it does not need to calculate a new route. Instead, it uses the Backup Route towards the destination.

4> Supports VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Mask) (Classless Subnet mask). It sends the subnet masks in the Update Packets.
5> Prevents routing loops on the network

 
EIGRP Tables:
------------
Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol has three tables. These tables are used on Routing Operation. The EIGRP Tables are given below:

 01> Neighbor Table: is the table that keeps All EIGRP Neighbour Routers.
 02> Topology Table: is the table that keeps All Routes to all the destinations
 03> Routing Table: is the table that keeps the Best Routes to any destinations.


EIGRP Metrics:
--------------
Uses a very complex metric by using bandwith, delay, load, reliability and MTU values.



CONFIGURATION:
-------------
Tut-Link: https://www.computernetworkingnotes.com/ccna-study-guide/eigrp-configuration-step-by-step-guide.html

Router(config)# router eigrp autonomous_system_#        (ASN (Autonomous System Number) from 1 to 65,535)
Router(config-router)# network IP_network_# [subnet_mask] 
**We have two options while defining the range of addresses with network command 01> Without wildcard mask 02> With wildcard 

Router(config)#router eigrp 1                           (configure eigrp with AS number)

   And passive interface for security

router eigrp 1
network 10.0.0.0 0.0.0.3
network 20.0.0.0 0.0.0.3
network 192.168.0.0 0.0.0.8
passive-interface f0/0


-------------------------: OPEN SHORTEST PATH FIRST (OSPF) :-----------------------------
                          =================================

Features and advantage of OSPF:-------
It supports both IPv4 and IPv6 routed protocols.
It supports load balancing with equal cost routes for same destination.
Since it is based on open standards, it will run on most routers.
It provides a loop free topology using SPF algorithm.
It is a classless protocol.
It supports VLSM and route summarization.
It supports unlimited hop counts.
It scales enterprise size network easily with area concept.
It supports trigger updates for fast convergence.
Just like other routing protocols, OSPF also has its negatives.

Disadvantage of OSPF:------
It requires extra CPU process to run SPF algorithm.
It requires more RAM to store adjacency topology.
It is more complex to setup and hard to troubleshoot.


OSPF Neighborship Requirement:----
In order to become OSPF neighbor following values must be match on both routers.
Area ID
Authentication
Hello and Dead Intervals
Stub Flag
MTU Size

OSPF Neighborship states:---------
OSPF routers go through the seven states while building neighborship with other routers.
Down state
Attempt/Init state
Two ways state
Exstart state
Exchange state
Loading state
Full state

CONFIGURATION:
--------------
Tut: https://www.computernetworkingnotes.com/ccna-study-guide/ospf-configuration-step-by-step-guide.html

Enabling OSPF is a two steps process:-
>>Enable OSPF routing protocol from global configuration mode.
>>Tell OSPF which interfaces we want to include.



For these steps following commands are used respectively.
Router(config)# router ospf process_ID
Router(config-router)# network IP_network_# [wild card mask] Area Number area number

R2(config)# router ospf 1
R2(config-router)# network 192.168.23.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
R2(config)# end

=========================================

04) 
   a) Reported Distance: The metric for a route as advertised by a neighbouring router.
      -----------------
   b) Feasible Distance: The metric for a route from the local router. This includes the RD+1.
      ------------------
   c) Successor: The route with the best metric to the destination.
      ----------
   d) Feasible Successor: A backup route if the successor fails. The FS must have a RD that is LESS than the Successor FD.
      -------------------
   
   e) ASN: Autonomous System Number:
   --------------------------------
   The autonomous system number used for EIGRP configuration is only significant to the EIGRP routing domain. 
   It functions as a process ID to help routers keep track of multiple, running instances of EIGRP. 
   This is required because it is possible to have more than one instance of EIGRP running on a network.
   ASN is from 1 to 65,535.


05) 
   a) Process ID:
   --------------
   Process ID is a positive integer. We can use any number from 1 to 65,535. 
   The Process ID is locally significant. It does not have to match on the neighbour router to form an adjacency.
   Only one instance is typically configured on OSPF routers – multiple Process IDs are very rarely used on same router. 
   
   b) Area ID:
   -----------
   Every router learns the full picture of the network including every router, its interfaces and what they connect to
   This can cause issues in large networks:
   Too many routes can use up too much router memory
   Network changes cause all routers to reconverge which takes time and CPU resources
   OSPF supports a hierarchical design which segments large networks into smaller areas to solve this problem
   Each router maintains full information about its own area, but only summary information about other areas
   
   A two level hierarchy is used:
   Transit area (backbone or area 0). Does not generally contain end users.
   Regular areas (nonbackbone areas). Used to connect end users to the Transit area. By default, all transit traffic goes through the Transit area.
   Small networks do not require a hierarchical design and all routers can be in Area 0


   
   c) Router ID:
   -------------
   Router ID which is in the form of an IP address. 
   ** OSPF routers identify themselves using an OSPF router id
   This will default to being the highest(ex: network 192.168.0.0 255.255.255.255) IP address of any loopback interfaces configured on the router, 
   or the highest other IP address if a loopback does not exist.
   Loopback interfaces never go down so the Router ID will not change. You can also manually specify the Router ID.
   *If a loopback or higher IP address is configured, the Router ID will change on OSPF process restart.
   *Best practice is to use a Loopback or manually set the Router ID.
   Example: router ospf 1 
            router-id 2.2.2.2
	    
	    
   d) Route Injection Meaning: create static ip route and originate for internet access
   e) How NOT to advertise a interface: passive the interface that's it.
  
  f) ABR(Area border router) router:
   ----------------------------------
   A router that connects one or more areas to the OSPF backbone.
   - Store both link-interface for Area 0 and Area 1 with Summary(it can't summary automaticaly)	    
	    

   g) Backbone Router: Routers which have all their OSPF interface in Area 0 are BACKBONE Router
   h) Transit Router: Transit Router is Backbone router.
   i) Inter Area Route: Routes to other areas appear as Inter Area (IA) routes
   j) Why multi-area concept: Too many routes can use up too much router memory To solve this problem Large networks segments into smaller area.
   k) How to do Manual Summary: #router ospf 1 #network 10.1.0.0 0.0.255.255 area 0 #area 0 range 10.1.0.0 255.255.0.0
    


  
06.  > Configure the default static route first for the backbone router: 
     #ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.2.0.0(Outgoing Interface)
     #router ospf 1
     #default-information originate
    -that's it.
    

07. DR and BDR: The Designated Router and Back-Up DR establish FULL neighbor state with all routers on the network segment. 
                   > DR is highest priority becomes and router with the 2nd highest priority becomes BDR
		   > Defaul priority is 1, The higher the better(0-255)
		     configuration:
		     #interface fa 0/0
		     #ip ospf priority 100
		     
		     #sh ip ospf interface fa 0/0
		     
      What DR and BDR do in OSPF:
      --------------------------
      DR and BDR serve as the central point for exchanging OSPF routing information. 
      Each non-DR or non-BDR router will exchange routing information only with the DR and BDR, 
      instead of exchanging updates with every router on the network segment.
