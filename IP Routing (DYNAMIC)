DYNAMIC ROUTING:
----------------
Dynamic routing protocols, dynamically learn network destinations and how to get to them and also advertise those destinations to other routers. 


ADV of DYNAMIC ROUTING TABLE:
-----------------------------
> Widely used.
> Used in Large network
> No need to configure, routing table update automaticaly.


Type of Dynamic Routing Protocols:
----------------------------------
A)IGP(Interior Gateway Protocol): 
    01) DISTANCE VECTOR (Algorithom Type): 
        The routers only learn the 'distance'(metric) and 'vector'(direction, the next-hop router) for each route.
        It only learn/know the information that its neighbors tell it('routing by rumor').
	  a> RIP   (Routing Information Protocol)
	  b> EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)
    02) LINK STATE (Algorithom Type): 
        Each router creates a independently 'connectivity map' to calculate the best routes to each destination of the network 
        and advertises this information until all neighbors develop the same map of the network. 
	--Faster than Distance Vector protocol but Use more resources(CPU) because more information is shared.
	a> OSPF  (Open Shortest Path First)
	b> IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System)
B)EGP (Exterior Gateway Protocol)
    01) PATH VECTOR (Algorithom Type): Analysis the path to reach the destination to learn if it is loop free or not. 
        a> BGP(Border Gateway Protocol)  


-------------------ROUTING INFORMATION PROTOCOL(RIP)----------------------------------------
                   =================================
-Send routing table's contents and network topology information to each of its adjacent routers every 30 seconds.. 
-Used in  small to medium-sized networks.
- Administrative Distance, Default Value is 120.
-The max. Matrix (hop count) allowed 15 and 16 is considered as network unreachable.
-When a route is removed from the routing table: 
	>It is flagged as unusable by the receiving routers after 180sec/3min, and 
	>Removed from their tables after an additional 120sec/+2min.

There are two versions of RIP (the managed switch supports both):

01> RIPv1 defined in RFC 1058.
    Routes are specified by IP destination network and hop count.
    The routing table is broadcast to all stations on the attached network.
02>RIPv2 defined in RFC 1723.
   Route specification also includes subnet mask and gateway.
   The routing table is sent to a multicast address, reducing network traffic.
   Authentication is used for security.

-------------------------: ENHANCED INTERIOR GATEWAY ROUTING PROTOCOL(EIGRP) :-----------------------------
                           =================================================
			   

EIGRP (DEFINATION and ADVANTAGE):
---------------------------------
1> EIGRP Protocol is one of the most used Dynamic (Hybrid) Routing Protocol as IGP
that show both Distance Vector and Link-State Routing Protocol properties.

2> It was developed by Cisco as an enhancement to IGRP (Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)
BUT Now it is OPEN Protocol. Works with IPv4, IPv6, IPX and AppleTalk Routed Protocols.

3> EIGRP uses DUAL (Diffusing Update Algorithm) for routing calculations. 
when a change occurs like router up/down, only routing table changes are propagated, not the entire routing table; 
this reduces the load the routing protocol itself places on the network

4> It is a Fast Converged Routing Protocol.
It keeps the “Backup Routes” beside the “Best Route” to a destination in the Topology table.
So, during a failure, it does not need to calculate a new route. Instead, it uses the Backup Route towards the destination.

5> Supports VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Mask) (Classless Subnet mask). It sends the subnet masks in the Update Packets.

6> Very low usage of network resources during normal operation; only hello packets are transmitted on a stable network




EIGRP Messages:
---------------
EIGRP uses different types of messages to build neighbourship, to keep the connection and for the updates. These main messages are :

 01> Hello: Packets are used to establish and maintain EIGRP Neighbourship.
     **It is possible for two routers to become EIGRP neighbors even though the hello and hold timers do not match.
 02> Update: Packets are used to send routing updates.
 03> Query: Packets are used to ask for any routing update, requests an update.
 04> Reply: Packets are used as a response to the Query Packets.
 05> ACK: Packets are used as a feedback to the Update, Query or Reply packets as a feedback mechanism.

 
EIGRP Tables:
------------
Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol has three tables. These tables are used on Routing Operation. The EIGRP Tables are given below:

 01> Neighbor Table: is the table that keeps All EIGRP Neighbour Routers.
 02> Topology Table: is the table that keeps All Routes to all the destinations
 03> Routing Table: is the table that keeps the Best Routes to any destinations.


EIGRP Metrics:
--------------
Uses a very complex metric by using bandwith, delay, load, reliability and MTU values.
