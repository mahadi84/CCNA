DYNAMIC ROUTING:
----------------
Dynamic routing protocols, dynamically learn network destinations and how to get to them and also advertise those destinations to other routers. 


ADV of DYNAMIC ROUTING TABLE:
-----------------------------
> Widely used.
> Used in Large network
> No need to configure, routing table update automaticaly.


Type of Dynamic Routing Protocols:
----------------------------------
A)IGP(Interior Gateway Protocol): 
    01) DISTANCE VECTOR (Algorithom Type): 
        -- The routers only learn the 'distance'(metric) and 'vector'(direction, the next-hop router) for each route.
	-- Routers do not have a complete network map of the topology, but only what it has been told by its neighbour aka "routing by rumour".
        -- Only advertise the best route , not every route that is aware of.
	-- Send their entire routing table to directly connected NEIGHBORS.	
	 a> RIP   (Routing Information Protocol)
	 b> EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)
	 
    02) LINK STATE (Algorithom Type): 
       -- Each router creates a independently COMPLETE 'connectivity map' to calculate the best routes to each destination of the network 
        and advertises this information until all neighbors develop the same map of the network.
       -- This protocol shares only the NETWORK TOPOLOGY information instead of advertising the entire routing table.
       -- Link state protocols send information about directly connected links to all the routers in the network.
       -- Faster than Distance Vector protocol but Use more resources(CPU) because more information is shared.
	a> OSPF  (Open Shortest Path First)
	b> IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System)
B)EGP (Exterior Gateway Protocol)
    01) PATH VECTOR (Algorithom Type): Analysis the path to reach the destination to learn if it is loop free or not. 
        a> BGP(Border Gateway Protocol)  


RIP vs OSPF vs IGRP vs EIGRP
----------------------------                                                                                         
RIP-The metrics used Is hop. -Used in  small to medium-sized networks.
IGRP-The metrics used are bandwidth, load, delay, MTU, and reliability.	
EIGRP-The metrics used are bandwidth, delay, load and reliability
OSPF-The metrics used are bandwidth and delay.	

RIP uses Distance vector algorithm to calculate the best path
IGRP uses the distance vector algorithm to calculate the best path and the variance mechanism to support unequal-cost load balancing.	
EIGRP uses Diffusing update algorithm to calculate the best path.
OSPF uses the SPF algorithm to calculate the best path.	

In RIP, networks are not divided into areas or tables.		
IGRP does not support areas or tables but supports multi-part routing.	
Routing with EIGRP is done in Neighbour Tables, Topology tables, and Routing tables.
Routing with OSPF is done in Autonomous System, Areas, Stub Areas and Backbone areas.

RIP-Maximum hop count is 15 16 is considered as network unreachable. 	
IGRP-Maximum hop count for IGRP-routed packets is 255 and the default is 100.	
EIGRP-Maximum hop count is 255.
OSPF-No hop count.

RIP- Administrative Distance, Default Value is 120.
IGRP- Administrative Distance, Default Value is 100
EIGRP- Administrative Distance, Default Value is EIGRP(summary route)-5, EIGRP(internal)-90, EIGRP(external)-170,
OSPF- Administrative Distance, Default Value is 110





-------------------ROUTING INFORMATION PROTOCOL(RIP)----------------------------------------
                   =================================
-Send routing table's contents and network topology information to each of its adjacent routers every 30 seconds.. 

-When a route is removed from the routing table: 
	>It is flagged as unusable by the receiving routers after 180sec/3min, and 
	>Removed from their tables after an additional 120sec/+2min.

There are two versions of RIP (the managed switch supports both):

01> RIPv1 defined in RFC 1058.
    Routes are specified by IP destination network and hop count.
    The routing table is broadcast to all stations on the attached network.
02>RIPv2 defined in RFC 1723.
   Route specification also includes subnet mask and gateway.
   The routing table is sent to a multicast address, reducing network traffic.
   Authentication is used for security.

-------------------------: ENHANCED INTERIOR GATEWAY ROUTING PROTOCOL(EIGRP) :-----------------------------
                           =================================================
			   

EIGRP (DEFINATION and ADVANTAGE):
---------------------------------
1> EIGRP Protocol is one of the most used Dynamic (Hybrid) Routing Protocol as IGP
that show both Distance Vector and Link-State Routing Protocol properties.

2> It was developed by Cisco as an enhancement to IGRP (Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)
BUT Now it is OPEN Protocol. Works with IPv4, IPv6, IPX and AppleTalk Routed Protocols.

3> EIGRP uses DUAL (Diffusing Update Algorithm) for routing calculations. 
when a change occurs like router up/down, only routing table changes are propagated, not the entire routing table; 
this reduces the load the routing protocol itself places on the network

4> It is a Fast Converged Routing Protocol.
It keeps the “Backup Routes” beside the “Best Route” to a destination in the Topology table.
So, during a failure, it does not need to calculate a new route. Instead, it uses the Backup Route towards the destination.

5> Supports VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Mask) (Classless Subnet mask). It sends the subnet masks in the Update Packets.
6> Very low usage of network resources during normal operation; only hello packets are transmitted on a stable network
7> Prevents routing loops on the network



EIGRP Messages:
---------------
EIGRP uses different types of messages to build neighbourship, to keep the connection and for the updates. These main messages are :

 01> Hello: Packets are used to establish and maintain EIGRP Neighbourship.
     **It is possible for two routers to become EIGRP neighbors even though the hello and hold timers do not match.
 02> Update: Packets are used to send routing updates.
 03> Query: Packets are used to ask for any routing update, requests an update.
 04> Reply: Packets are used as a response to the Query Packets.
 05> ACK: Packets are used as a feedback to the Update, Query or Reply packets as a feedback mechanism.

 
EIGRP Tables:
------------
Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol has three tables. These tables are used on Routing Operation. The EIGRP Tables are given below:

 01> Neighbor Table: is the table that keeps All EIGRP Neighbour Routers.
 02> Topology Table: is the table that keeps All Routes to all the destinations
 03> Routing Table: is the table that keeps the Best Routes to any destinations.


EIGRP Metrics:
--------------
Uses a very complex metric by using bandwith, delay, load, reliability and MTU values.

*Reported Distance: The metric for a route as advertised by a neighbouring router.
*Feasible Distance: The metric for a route from the local router. This includes the RD+1.

**Successor:- The route with the best metric to the destination.
**Feasible Successor: A backup route if the successor fails. The FS must have a RD that is LESS than the Successor FD.

-------------------------: OPEN SHORTEST PATH FIRST (OSPF) :-----------------------------
                          =================================

Features and advantage of OSPF:-------
It supports both IPv4 and IPv6 routed protocols.
It supports load balancing with equal cost routes for same destination.
Since it is based on open standards, it will run on most routers.
It provides a loop free topology using SPF algorithm.
It is a classless protocol.
It supports VLSM and route summarization.
It supports unlimited hop counts.
It scales enterprise size network easily with area concept.
It supports trigger updates for fast convergence.
Just like other routing protocols, OSPF also has its negatives.

Disadvantage of OSPF:------
It requires extra CPU process to run SPF algorithm.
It requires more RAM to store adjacency topology.
It is more complex to setup and hard to troubleshoot.


OSPF Neighborship Requirement:----
In order to become OSPF neighbor following values must be match on both routers.
Area ID
Authentication
Hello and Dead Intervals
Stub Flag
MTU Size

OSPF Neighborship states:---------
OSPF routers go through the seven states while building neighborship with other routers.
Down state
Attempt/Init state
Two ways state
Exstart state
Exchange state
Loading state
Full state
