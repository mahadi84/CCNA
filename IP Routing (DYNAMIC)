Type of Dynamic Routing Protocols:
A)IGP(Interior Gateway Protocol): 
    01) DISTANCE VECTOR (Algorithom Type): 
        The routers only learn the 'distance'(metric) and 'vector'(direction, the next-hop router) for each route.
        It only learn/know the information that its neighbors tell it('routing by rumor').
	  a> RIP   (Routing Information Protocol)
	  b> EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)
    02) LINK STATE (Algorithom Type): 
        Each router creates a independently 'connectivity map' to calculate the best routes to each destination of the network 
        and advertises this information until all neighbors develop the same map of the network. 
	--Faster than Distance Vector protocol but Use more resources(CPU) because more information is shared.
	a> OSPF  (Open Shortest Path First)
	b> IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System)
B)EGP (Exterior Gateway Protocol)
    01) PATH VECTOR (Algorithom Type)
        a> BGP(Border Gateway Protocol)  


ROUTING INFORMATION PROTOCOL(RIP)
=================================
-Send routing table's contents and network topology information to each of its adjacent routers every 30 seconds.. 
-Used in  small to medium-sized networks. 
-The max. hop count allowed 15 and a hop count of 16 is considered as network unreachable.
-When a route is removed from the routing table, 
it is flagged as unusable by the receiving routers after 180sec/3min, and removed from their tables after an additional 120sec/+2min.
-Administrative Distance for RIP is 120.

There are two versions of RIP (the managed switch supports both):

01> RIPv1 defined in RFC 1058.
    Routes are specified by IP destination network and hop count.
    The routing table is broadcast to all stations on the attached network.
02>RIPv2 defined in RFC 1723.
   Route specification also includes subnet mask and gateway.
   The routing table is sent to a multicast address, reducing network traffic.
   Authentication is used for security.
