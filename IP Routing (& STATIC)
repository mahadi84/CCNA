--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


IP ROUTING:
-----------
Is the process of sending packets from a host on one network to another host on a different remote network.
This process is usually done by routers. Routers examine the destination IP address of a packet , determine the next-hop address, and forward the packet.
Routers use routing tables to determine the next hop address to which the packet should be forwarded.


ROUTING TABLE:
--------------
A routing table is used by routers to determine the path to the destination network. 
Each router maintains a routing table and stores it in RAM. 

Each routing table consists of the following entries:
01. IP addresses and Subnet mask of the destination host and the network
02. IP addresses of all those routers which are required to reach the destination network.
03. Outgoing interface information
 

Populating a routing table:
---------------------------
There are three different methods:
01. Directly connected subnets
02. Static routing
03. Dynamic routing

 
A) ROUTER MATRIC:
=================
If a routers learns about multiple different paths to the same network from the same routing protocol, 
a measure called metric is used to decide which route will be placed in the routing table. 
Just like with the administrative distance, the lower number represents the better route.

Each routing protocol has its own way to calculate the metric; 
RIP uses hop counts, OSPF uses a parameter called cost, 
EIGRP uses bandwidth and the delay to compute the metrics, etc. 
Note that metrics of different routing protocols can not be directly compared – 
an EIGRP route might have a metric of 4.042.334, while a RIP route can have a metric of 3. 
 

B) ADMINISTRATIVE DISTANCE (AD):
================================
AD is the first criterion that a router uses to determine which routing protocol to use if two protocols provide route information for the same destination.
AD is a measure of the trustworthiness of the source of the routing information.
AD has only local significance, and is not advertised in routing updates.

Note: The smaller the AD value, the more reliable the protocol. 
For example, if a router receives a route to a certain network from both Open Shortest Path First (OSPF, default AD-110) 
and Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP, default AD-100), the router chooses IGRP because IGRP is more reliable. 
This means the router adds the IGRP version of the route to the routing table.

If you lose the source of the IGRP-derived information (for example, due to a power shutdown), 
the software uses the OSPF-derived information until the IGRP-derived information reappears.

AD value for Routing Protocol:
------------------------------
Static route-1, OSPF-110, IS-IS-115, RIP-120, EIGRP(summary route)-5, EIGRP(internal)-90, EIGRP(external)-170, 
BGP-20, BGP(internal)-200, IGRP-100, EGP-140.



C)----------ADMIN DISTANCE------VS------METRICS-----------------------
>>ADMIN DISTANCE - Is a number denoting how believable an entire routing protocol is on a single router.
                   Administrative Distance is locally significant, it is not advertised anywhere
                   (This is useful when a router is running many routing protocols and cant decide which to use)
                   (The lower it is, the more believable it is)


>>METRICS - A number denoting the best route (to reach a subnet) in a single routing protocol on a single router
            A Metric is dependent on the other routers (neighbors) along the path, and it is advertised between neighbors.
           (Useful when a routing protocl has many routes to a single network and cant decide which to use)
           (The lower it is, the more believable it is)




D) NEXT HOP:
============
It refers to the next closest router, a packet can go through. 


E) ROUTING PROTOCOL CODE:
=========================
Identifies by which routing protocol each route was learned.

C - Connected   S - Static    I - IGRP
R - RIP         B - BGP       D - EIGRP
EX  -EIGRP external  O - OSPF


F) GATEWAY OF LAST RESORT:
==========================
A Gateway of Last Resort or Default gateway is a route used by the router when no other known route exists to transmit the IP packet. 
Known routes are present in the routing table. Hence, any route not known by the routing table is forwarded to the default route.


G) WILDCARD MASK:
-------------
Wildcard mask are used with network ID to filter the interfaces. Wildcard mask is different from subnet mask. 
Subnet mask is used to separate the network portion and host portion in IP address.
While wildcard mask is used to match corresponding octet in network portion.
With wildcard we can also filter Subnetted networks as well as default networks. 
Example: We can use a wildcard mask of 0.0.0.255 to match the subnet mask of /24.

Key points:--
0 (Decimal – octet format) Wildcard mask indicates that corresponding octet in network address must be matched exactly.
255 (Decimal – octet format) Wildcard mask indicates that we don’t care about corresponding octet in network address.

Subnetmask        255        255      255         0
               11111111   11111111  11111111   00000000

Wildcardmask      0         0         0         255
               00000000  00000000  00000000   11111111
               
**** The binary 1s and 0s of the wildcard mask are flipped compared to the subnet mask.
     A subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 is the same as wildcard mask 0.0.0.255.

H) MTU:
-------
Maximum Transmission unit, is the largest size packet that can be delivered in bytes without fragmentation.


I) STUB AREA:
-------------
OSPF allows certain areas to be configured as stub areas. External networks, such as those redistributed from other protocols into OSPF, 
are not allowed to be flooded into a stub area. Routing from these areas to the outside world is based on a default route. 
Configuring a stub area reduces the topological database size inside an area and reduces the memory requirements of routers inside that area.

J) Loopback Interface in OSPF:
-----------------------------
Loopback interfaces are logical interfaces, which are virtual, software-only interfaces; they are not real router interfaces. 

**It ensures that an interface is always active for OSPF processes.
They can be used for OSPF configuration  as well as  diagnostic purposes . 


04) CMD TO ADD IP TO INTERFACE:
================================
en
config t
hostname R01
int serial 2/0   OR   fa 0/0
ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0
no shutdown

 Advance:    https://www.computernetworkingnotes.com/ccna-study-guide/static-routing-configuration-guide-with-examples.html

STATIC ROUTING:
--------------
Static routes are manually added to a routing table through direct configuration. 
Note that, static routes are not widely used today, since you have to configure each static route manually on each router in the network.

ADV of STATIC ROUTING TABLE:
-----------------------------
> Very little load on the CPU of the router, and Bandwidth is not used for sending the routing updates.
> Leaves the network administrator with full control over the routing behavior of the network.
> Very easy to configure on small networks.


CONFIGURATION: 
--------------
Router(config)#ip route [destination_network][dst_subnet_mask][next-hop_address or exitinterface]   (need info. to config. Static route)

Router#show ip route  (command to print all static routes)
Router#no ip route    (command to delete the route.)
