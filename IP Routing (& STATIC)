IP ROUTING:
-----------
Is the process of sending packets from a host on one network to another host on a different remote network.
This process is usually done by routers. Routers examine the destination IP address of a packet , determine the next-hop address, and forward the packet.
Routers use routing tables to determine the next hop address to which the packet should be forwarded.


ROUTING TABLE:
--------------
A routing table is used by routers to determine the path to the destination network. 
Each router maintains a routing table and stores it in RAM. 

Each routing table consists of the following entries:
01. IP addresses and Subnet mask of the destination host and the network
02. IP addresses of all those routers which are required to reach the destination network.
03. Outgoing interface information
 

Populating a routing table:
---------------------------

There are three different methods:
01. Directly connected subnets
02. Static routing
03. Dynamic routing


STATING ROUTING: 
---------------
Static routes are manually added to a routing table through direct configuration. 
Note that, static routes are not widely used today, since you have to configure each static route manually on each router in the network.

Adv. of STATIC ROUTING TABLE:
-----------------------------
> Very little load on the CPU of the router, and Bandwidth is not used for sending the routing updates.
> Leaves the network administrator with full control over the routing behavior of the network.
> Very easy to configure on small networks.


Configuration: 
--------------
Router#show ip route  (command to print all static routes)
Router#no ip route    (command to delete the route.)
Router(config)#ip route [destination_network][dst_subnet_mask][next-hop_address or exitinterface]   (need info. to config. Static route)

ROUTER MATRIC:
==============
If a routers learns about multiple different paths to the same network from the same routing protocol, 
a measure called metric is used to decide which route will be placed in the routing table. 
Just like with the administrative distance, the lower number represents the better route.

Each routing protocol has its own way to calculate the metric; 
RIP uses hop counts, OSPF uses a parameter called cost, 
EIGRP uses bandwidth and the delay to compute the metrics, etc. 
Note that metrics of different routing protocols can not be directly compared â€“ 
an EIGRP route might have a metric of 4.042.334, while a RIP route can have a metric of 3. 
 

ADMINISTRATIVE DISTANCE (AD):
============================
AD is the first criterion that a router uses to determine which routing protocol to use if two protocols provide route information for the same destination.
AD is a measure of the trustworthiness of the source of the routing information.
AD has only local significance, and is not advertised in routing updates.

Note: The smaller the AD value, the more reliable the protocol. 
For example, if a router receives a route to a certain network from both Open Shortest Path First (OSPF, default AD-110) 
and Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP, default AD-100), the router chooses IGRP because IGRP is more reliable. 
This means the router adds the IGRP version of the route to the routing table.

If you lose the source of the IGRP-derived information (for example, due to a power shutdown), 
the software uses the OSPF-derived information until the IGRP-derived information reappears.

AD value for Routing Protocol:
------------------------------
Static route-1, EIGRP (summary route)-5, BGP- 20, Internal EIGRP- 90, IGRP- 100, OSPF- 110, IS-IS- 115, RIP- 120,
EGP- 140, External EIGRP-170, Internal BGP-200
