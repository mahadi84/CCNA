OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model was created by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), an international standard-setting body. 
TCP/IP model was created in the 1970s by the Defense Advance Research Project Agency (DARPA) as an open, vendor-neutral, public networking model.

OSI                                                                      TCP/IP

PROTOCOLS:
----------
ARP(Address Resolution Protocol) broadcasts a request packet to all the machines on the LAN and asks if any of the machines are using that particular IP address. 
When a machine recognizes the IP address as its own, it sends a reply so ARP can update the cache for future reference and proceed with the communication.
ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) – used to detects and reports network error conditions. Used in ping.

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) – a connection-oriented protocol that enables reliable data transfer between two computers.
UDP (User Datagram Protocol) – a connectionless protocol for data transfer. Since a session is not created before the data transfer, there is no guarantee of data delivery.

Telnet (Telecommunications Network) – used to connect/login and issue commands on a remote computer/device. All data sent via an SSH connection is NOT encrypted.
SSH "Secure Shell." is a method of securely communicating(connect/login) with another computer/device. All data sent via an SSH connection is encrypted.

ENCAPSULATION:
--------------
The term encapsulation is used to describe a process of adding headers and trailers around some data.

The TCP/IP model uses terms like segment, packet and frame to refer to a data packet defined by a particular layer. 
Whereas OSI model uses a different term: protocol data unit (PDU). A PDU represent a unit of data with headers and trailers for the particular layer, 
as well as the encapsulated data.



PORT:
-----
A port is a 16-bit number used to identify specific applications and services.
Port numbers are from 0 to 65535. The first 1024 ports are reserved for use by certain privileged services:
