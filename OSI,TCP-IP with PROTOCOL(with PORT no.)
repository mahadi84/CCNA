OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model was created by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), an international standard-setting body. 
TCP/IP model was created in the 1970s by the Defense Advance Research Project Agency (DARPA) as an open, vendor-neutral, public networking model.

OSI                                                                      TCP/IP

01.APPLICATION    --------|HTTP, FTP, SMTP, TELNET, SSH, DNS, SNMP
02.PRESENTATION   --------|SSL, TLS, MIME,                               01.APPLICATION
03.SESSION        --------|NetBIOS

04.TRANSPORT      --------|TCP, UDP  (PORT)                              02.TRANSPORT

05.NETWORK        --------|IPv4, IPv6, ARP, ICMP  (IP)                   03.INTERNET

06.DATALINK       --------|PPP, HDLC (MAC)                               04.NETWORK
07.PHYSICAL       --------|ETHERNET


PROTOCOLS:
----------
ARP(Address Resolution Protocol) broadcasts a request packet to all the machines on the LAN and asks if any of the machines are using that particular IP address. 
When a machine recognizes the IP address as its own, it sends a reply so ARP can update the cache for future reference and proceed with the communication.
ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) – used to detects and reports network error conditions. Used in ping.

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) – a connection-oriented protocol that enables reliable data transfer between two computers.
UDP (User Datagram Protocol) – a connectionless protocol for data transfer. Since a session is not created before the data transfer, there is no guarantee of data delivery.


ENCAPSULATION:
--------------
The term encapsulation is used to describe a process of adding headers and trailers around some data.

The TCP/IP model uses terms like segment, packet and frame to refer to a data packet defined by a particular layer. 
Whereas OSI model uses a different term: protocol data unit (PDU). A PDU represent a unit of data with headers and trailers for the particular layer, 
as well as the encapsulated data.


=================== PROTOCOL with PORT =================================

PORT:
-----
A port is a 16-bit number used to identify specific applications and services.
Port numbers are from 0 to 65535. The first 1024 ports are reserved for use by certain privileged services:


Protocols     Ports        Description
---------     ------       -------------
FTP           20/21        File Transfer Protocol. Allows transfer of files between computers/host
TFTP           69          Trivial File Transfer Protocol
SSH            22          Secure Shell. Provides a SECURE or unencrypted connection between host systems (for LOGIN/CONFIGURE)
TELNET         23          Provides INSECURE connection to remote computer/hosts  (for LOGIN/CONFIGURE)
HTTP           80          HyperText Transfer Protocol. Allows access to web servers
HTTPS         443          This is the secure or encrypted version of HTTP. Provides secure access to web servers.
SMTP           25          Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. Facilitates delivery of mail
DNS            53          Domain Name System. Resolves domain names to IP addresses
POP3          110          Post Office Protocol. Allows the download of mail from mail servers
IMAP          143          Internet Message Access Protocol. It Allows access to mail stored on a mail server.
SNMP          161          Simple Network Management Protocol. Allows you to monitor network devices.
DHCP         67,68         Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
