===================================================) 00 TYPE OF SWITCH (==========================================

Types of Network Switch:
------------------------
    01. Access Layer Switches:
    --------------------------
    - End hosts such as desktop computers, servers and IP phones connect into the network at the access layer
    - It is designed to have a high port count at an affordable cost
    - Desktops typically have only one Network Interface Card (NIC) so they connect into one switch or Wireless Access Point
    - Servers will often have dual NICs and connect to a pair of redundant switches
    - Client access security measures are enabled at the Access Layer

    02. Distributed Layer Switches:
    -------------------------------
    - Access Layer switches uplink to Distribution Layer switches
    - The Distribution Layer switches serve as an aggregation point for the 
    - Distribution Layer switches are typically deployed in redundant pairs, with downstream Access Layer switches connected to both
    - End hosts are not typically connected here
    - Most software policy such as QoS is enabled at this layer
    
    03. Core Layer Switches:
    ------------------------
    - Distribution Layer switches uplink to Core Layer switches
    - Core Layer switches are typically deployed in redundant pairs, with downstream Distribution Layer switches connected to both
    - Traffic between different parts of the campus travels through the core  so it is designed for speed and resiliency
    - Software policy slows the switch down so should be avoided in the Core Layer

===================================================) 01 ADV and DADV VLAN(==========================================
Advantages and Disadvantages of VLAN:
-------------------------------------
Advantages to VLAN include reduced broadcast traffic, security, ease of administration and broadcast domain confinement.

Disadvantage of VLANs includes the limitation of 4,096 VLANs per switching domain creates problems for large hosting providers,
which often need to allocate tens or hundreds of VLANs for each customer. 

To address this limitation, other protocols, like The Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is used to create loop-free topology, 
VXLAN(Virtual Extensible LAN), NVGRE (Network Virtualization using Generic Routing Encapsulation) 
and Geneve, support larger tags and the ability to tunnel Layer 2 frames within Layer 3 (network) packets.



==================================) 02. TO CHECK (=====================================

TO CHECK: (interface/port,ip,vlan and trunk configuration)
----------------------------------------------------------
Switch#show ?  (all available command)
Switch#show ip interface brief
Switch#show int fa 0/1
Switch#show interface FastEthernet 0/1 switchport
Switch#show interface status
Switch#show interface switchport 
Switch#show interface trunk   ( if TRUNK is avaiable)
Switch#show vlan brief


==================================) 03. CONFIGURE (=====================================

VLAN CREATE, CONFIGURE, ASSIGN to INTERFACE On SWITCH:
-----------------------------------------------------
Tut: https://www.computernetworkingnotes.com/ccna-study-guide/configure-dhcp-server-for-multiple-vlans-on-the-switch.html

SW1(config)#vlan 10                     (create vlan)
SW1(config-vlan)#name Eng               (create name of the vlan)
SW1(config)#interface FastEthernet 0/1 
SW1(config-if)#switchport mode access 
SW1(config-if)#switchport access vlan 10 

SW1(config)#interface range FastEthernet 0/3-5 
SW1(config-if)#switchport mode access 
SW1(config-if)#switchport access vlan 10

Switch(config-if)# switchport mode trunk/dynamic/trunk	
  *trunk	Set trunking mode to ACCESS unconditionally
  dynamic	Set trunking mode to dynamically negotiate trunk or trunk mode
  trunk	Set trunking mode to TRUNK unconditionally


TO DELETE VLAN and ACCESS:
--------------------------
Switch(config)# int f 0/1 	(Enter in Interface configuration mode)
Switch(config-if)#no switchport access vlan 10	(Removes interface from VLAN 10 and reassigns it to the default VLAN – VLAN 1)
Switch(config)#no vlan 10	 (Delete VLAN 10 from VLAN database)


==================================) 04. DTP and VTP(=====================================

DYNAMIC TRUNKING PROTOCOL:
--------------------------
If two Cisco switches are cabled together they can negotiate a trunk connection using Cisco’s Dynamic Trunking Protocol DTP
It is however recommended to manually configure switch ports 

Manual configuration:
#switchport mode access 
#switchport mode trunk

DTP configuration:
>Switchport mode dynamic auto: will form a trunk if the neighbour switch port is set to trunk or desirable.
                               Trunk will not be formed if both sides are set to auto. Default on newer switches.
>Switchport mode dynamic desirable: will form a trunk if the neighbour switch port is set to trunk, desirable or auto. Default on older switches.
>Switchport nonegotiate: disables DTP

VLAN TRUNING PROTOCOL VTP:
--------------------------
> The VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP) allows you to add, edit or delete, VLANs on switches configured as VTP Servers, 
  and have other switches configured as VTP Clients synchronise their VLAN database with them
> This can be convenient if you manage a large campus
> You will still need to perform port level VLAN configuration on the switches

>> Be careful if using VTP – if you accidentally introduce a switch with a higher VLAN database revision number into the domain 
it can wipe out all your production VLANs
>> If using both DTP and VTP, the VTP domain name has to match on neighbour switches for trunks to be formed by DTP
 
VTP MODES:
-----------
> VTP Server: Can add, edit or delete VLANs. A VTP Server will synchronise its VLAN database from another Server with a higher revision number.
> VTP Client: Cannot add, edit or delete VLANs. A VTP Client will synchronise its VLAN database from the Server with the highest revision number.
> VTP Transparent: Does not participate in the VTP domain. Does not advertise or learn VLAN information but will pass it on. 
    Can add, edit or delete VLANs in its own local VLAN database.
    
CONFIGURATION:-----------    
SW1(config)#vtp domain Flackbox 
SW1(config)#vtp mode server
or
SW1(config)#vtp mode client
or
SW1(config)#vtp mode transparent
SW1(config)#vlan 20 
SW1(config-vlan)#name sales
(Cannot add VLAN if VTP Client)

SW1#show vtp status



=========================) 05. DOT1Q TRUNKS (=================================


> An access port carries traffic for one specific VLAN
> Dot1Q trunks are configured on the links between switches where we need to carry traffic for multiple VLANs
> ISL (Inter-Switch Link) was a Cisco proprietary trunking protocol which is now obsolete
> When the switch forwards traffic to another switch, it tags the layer 2 Dot1Q header with the correct VLAN
> The receiving switch will only forward the traffic out ports that are in that VLAN
> The switch removes the Dot1Q tag from the Ethernet frame when it sends it to the end host


================================) 06. INTER VLAN ROUTING (=============================

There are 3 methodes used for INTER-VLAN-ROUTING:

01. ROUTER WITH SEPARATE INTERFACES (Router must have as many PHYSICAL INTERFACES as no. of VLANs) 
02. ROUTER ON A STICK (Router's LOGICAL interface are configured and used) 
03. LAYER 3 SWITCH


01. ROUTER WITH SEPARATE INTERFACES
------------------------------------
You need a separate physical interface for every VLAN you are liable to RUN OUT of interfaces

R1(config)#interface FastEthernet 0/1 
R1(config-interface)#ip address 10.10.10.1 255.255.255.0 
R1(config)#interface FastEthernet 0/2 
R1(config-interface)#ip address 10.10.20.1 255.255.255.0 
R1(config)#ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 203.0.113.2

SW1(config)#interface FastEthernet 0/1 
SW1(config-if)#switchport mode access 
SW1(config-if)#switchport access vlan 10 
SW1(config)#interface FastEthernet 0/2 
SW1(config-if)#switchport mode access 
SW1(config-if)#switchport access vlan 20

02. ROUTER ON STICK:
--------------------
**Router's LOGICAL interface are create, configured and used.

Router#vlan database
Router(vlan)#vlan 40 name SALES
Router#show vlan brief


R1(config)#interface FastEthernet 0/1 
R1(config-interface)#no ip address 
R1(config-interface)#no shutdown

R1(config)#interface FastEthernet 0/1.10  (Logical Extended Ethernet port 0/1)
R1(config-interface)#encapsulation dot1q 10 
R1(config-interface)#ip address 10.10.10.1 255.255.255.0 

R1(config)#interface FastEthernet 0/1.20   (Logical Extended Ethernet port 0/1)
R1(config-interface)#encapsulation dot1q 20 
R1(config-interface)#ip address 10.10.20.1 255.255.255.0 

R1(config)#ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 203.0.113.2  (To connect to internet)

SW1(config)#interface FastEthernet 0/1 
SW1(config-if)#switchport mode trunk

03. LAYER 3 SWITCH
------------------

> Traffic being routed within the campus is routed across the switch backplane, it does not need to travel over physical cables to an external router
> You may still need an external router for WAN connectivity and services

Global Configuration for SWITCH:-------
SW1(config)#ip routing
SW1(config)#interface vlan 10
SW1(config-if)#ip address 10.10.10.1 255.255.255.0 
SW1(config)#interface vlan 20
SW1(config-if)#ip address 10.10.20.1 255.255.255.0

FOR WAN Configuration:----
SW1(config)#interface FastEthernet 0/1
SW1(config-if)#no switchport
SW1(config-if)#ip address 10.10.100.1 255.255.255.0 
SW1(config)#ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.10.100.2

R1(config)#interface FastEthernet 0/1 
R1(config-interface)#ip address 10.10.100.2 255.255.255.0 
R1(config)#interface FastEthernet 0/2 
R1(config-interface)#ip address 203.0.113.1 255.255.255.0 
R1(config)#ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 203.0.113.2 
R1(config)#ip route 10.10.0.0 255.255.0.0 10.10.100.1
