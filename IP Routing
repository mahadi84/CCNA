IP ROUTING:
-----------
Is the process of sending packets from a host on one network to another host on a different remote network.
This process is usually done by routers. Routers examine the destination IP address of a packet , determine the next-hop address, and forward the packet.
Routers use routing tables to determine the next hop address to which the packet should be forwarded.


ROUTING TABLE:
--------------
A routing table is used by routers to determine the path to the destination network. 
Each router maintains a routing table and stores it in RAM. 
Each routing table consists of the following entries:

01. Network destination and subnet mask – specifies a range of IP addresses.
02. Remote router – IP address of the router used to reach that network.
03. Outgoing interface – outgoing interface the packet should go out to reach the destination network.
 

Populating a routing table:
---------------------------
There are three different methods:

01. Directly connected subnets
02. Using static routing
03. Using dynamic routing
