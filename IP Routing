    To check static Router address
    To Add static router address
04. What is AD value in Routing Table?



IP ROUTING:
-----------
Is the process of sending packets from a host on one network to another host on a different remote network.
This process is usually done by routers. Routers examine the destination IP address of a packet , determine the next-hop address, and forward the packet.
Routers use routing tables to determine the next hop address to which the packet should be forwarded.


ROUTING TABLE:
--------------
A routing table is used by routers to determine the path to the destination network. 
Each router maintains a routing table and stores it in RAM. 

Each routing table consists of the following entries:
01. IP addresses and Subnet mask of the destination host and the network
02. IP addresses of all those routers which are required to reach the destination network.
03. Outgoing interface information
 

Populating a routing table:
---------------------------

There are three different methods:
01. Directly connected subnets
02. Static routing
03. Dynamic routing


STATING ROUTING: 
---------------
Static routes are manually added to a routing table through direct configuration. 
Note that, static routes are not widely used today, since you have to configure each static route manually on each router in the network.

Adv. of STATIC ROUTING TABLE:
-----------------------------
> Very little load on the CPU of the router, and Bandwidth is not used for sending the routing updates.
> Leaves the network administrator with full control over the routing behavior of the network.
> Very easy to configure on small networks.


Configuration: ( https://www.tutorialandexample.com/static-routing/ )
--------------
Router#show ip route  (command to print all static routes)
Router#no ip route    (command to delete the route.)
Router(config)#ip route [destination_network][dst_subnet_mask][next-hop_address or exitinterface]   (need info. to config. Static route)

 AD value of Static Routing Table:
 ---------------------------------
 It is an integer value ranging from 0 to 255 where 0 shows that the route is most trusted and 255 means that no traffic will be passed through that route 
 or that route is never installed in the routing table.
