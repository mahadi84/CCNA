IP ROUTING:
-----------
Is the process of sending packets from a host on one network to another host on a different remote network.
This process is usually done by routers. Routers examine the destination IP address of a packet , determine the next-hop address, and forward the packet.
Routers use routing tables to determine the next hop address to which the packet should be forwarded.


ROUTING TABLE:
--------------
A routing table is used by routers to determine the path to the destination network. 
Each router maintains a routing table and stores it in RAM. 

Each routing table consists of the following entries:
01. IP addresses and Subnet mask of the destination host and the network
02. IP addresses of all those routers which are required to reach the destination network.
03. Outgoing interface information
 

Populating a routing table:
---------------------------

There are three different methods:
01. Directly connected subnets
02. Static routing
03. Dynamic routing


STATING ROUTING:
---------------
Static routes are manually added to a routing table through direct configuration. 
Using a static route, a router can learn about a route to a remote network that is not directly attached to one of its interfaces. 
Note that, however, static routes are not widely used today, since you have to configure each static route manually on each router in the network.

Configuration:
--------------
Static routes are configured in the global configuration mode using the ip route DESTINATION_NETWORK SUBNET_MASK NEXT_HOP_IP_ADDRESS command. 
The NEXT_HOP_IP_ADDRESS parameter is the IP address of the next-hop router that will receive packets and forward them to the remote network. 
The router with the next-hop IP address must be on a directly connected network.
