01.
Broadcast traffic:
------------------
is a message that is sent out to every node on the network or a portion of the network (LAN segment).

Broadcast Storm and  Its causes:
-------------------------------
Extreme amounts of broadcast traffic/ARP request constitute a "broadcast storm". 
It can consume sufficient network resources and the network crash.

02. How does a ROUTER/Layer 3/2 switch take care of Braodcast Strom?
====================================================================
Layer 3 routing and HSRP control the path selection and provide automatic failover for Layer 3 connections
Dynamic routing protocols have built-in loop prevention mechanisms and TTL acts as a final failsafe.

How will path selection, failover and loop prevention work for the Layer 2 only switches?
Here Spanning Tree Protocol solve the problem.


03. What and Why is STP?
========================
A broadcast storm is disastrous for the LAN and must be avoided at all costs. 
The Spanning Tree Protocol is used to prevent Layer 2 loops.
It does this by detecting potential loops and blocking ports to prevent them.

The access layer switches can only use half of their physically cabled uplink bandwidth. 
Spanning Tree is a necessary evil because a broadcast storm would be a far worse scenario.

Spanning Tree automates failover as well as performing loop prevention. If an Access Layer switchâ€™s uplink to CD1 fails, the link to CD2 will 
transition from a blocking to a forwarding state. Legacy Spanning Tree can take up to 50 seconds to converge.



04.Version of Spanning Tree Protocol and Adv of them:
=====================================================
Spanning Tree Protocol (STP):- 
The original Spanning Tree 
implementation. Uses one Spanning Tree for all VLANs in the LAN.

Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP):-
Significantly improved 
convergence time. Uses one Spanning Tree for all VLANs in the LAN.

Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (MSTP):-
Enables grouping and 
mapping VLANs into different spanning tree instances for load balancing.
