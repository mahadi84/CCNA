05. What/Why is Root Bridge?

01.
Broadcast traffic: is a message that is sent out to every node on the network or a portion of the network (LAN segment).
------------------

Broadcast Storm and It causes:
-------------------------------
Extreme amounts of broadcast traffic/ARP request constitute a "broadcast storm". 
It can consume sufficient network resources and the network crash.

02. How does a ROUTER/Layer 3/2 switch take care of Braodcast Strom?
====================================================================
Layer 3 routing and HSRP control the path selection and provide automatic failover for Layer 3 connections
Dynamic routing protocols have built-in loop prevention mechanisms and TTL acts as a final failsafe.

How will path selection, failover and loop prevention work for the Layer 2 only switches?
Here Spanning Tree Protocol solve the problem.

03. What is Root Bridge? and How to Elect it?
=============================================
Root bridge  acts as a centre point of the LAN. 
Best practice is to ensure a pair of high-end core switches are selected as the 1st and 2nd most preferred Root Bridge

-You can manipulate the Root Bridge election by setting Bridge priority
    > Core1(config)#spanning-tree vlan 1 root primary
    > Core2(config)#spanning-tree vlan 1 root secondary
    > To Check: show spanning-tree vlan 1
-The default value is 32768, with the lowest number being most preferred
-In the case of a tie the switch with the lowest MAC address will be selected
-This is liable to be the oldest switch


04. What and Why is STP?
========================
A broadcast storm is disastrous for the LAN and must be avoided at all costs. 
The Spanning Tree Protocol is used to prevent Layer 2 loops.

It does this by detecting potential loops and blocking ports to prevent them.

The access layer switches can only use half of their physically cabled uplink bandwidth. 
Spanning Tree is a necessary evil because a broadcast storm would be a far worse scenario.

Spanning Tree selects paths pointing towards the root bridge 
Spanning Tree automates failover as well as performing loop prevention. If an Access Layer switchâ€™s uplink to CD1 fails, the link to CD2 will 
transition from a blocking to a forwarding state. Legacy Spanning Tree can take up to 50 seconds to converge.


05.Version of Spanning Tree Protocol and Adv of them:
=====================================================
Spanning Tree Protocol (STP):- 
The original Spanning Tree implementation. Uses one Spanning Tree for all VLANs in the LAN.

Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP):-
Significantly improved convergence time. Uses one Spanning Tree for all VLANs in the LAN.

Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (MSTP):-
Enables grouping and mapping VLANs into different spanning tree instances for load balancing.
