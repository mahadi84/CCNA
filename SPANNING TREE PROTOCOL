There will be more broadcast traffic on a production network than a single ARP request We now have a broadcast storm The network will crash because the 
amount of looping broadcast traffic will quickly overwhelm the switch’s CPU and bandwidth.

A broadcast storm is disastrous for the LAN and must be avoided at all costs. The Spanning Tree Protocol is used to prevent Layer 2 loops.
It does this by detecting potential loops and blocking ports to prevent them.

The access layer switches can only use half of their physically cabled uplink bandwidth. 
Spanning Tree is a necessary evil because a broadcast storm would be a far worse scenario.

Spanning Tree automates failover as well as performing loop prevention. If an Access Layer switch’s uplink to CD1 fails, the link to CD2 will 
transition from a blocking to a forwarding state. Legacy Spanning Tree can take up to 50 seconds to converge.
