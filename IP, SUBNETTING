IP(Internet Protocol)
---------------------
An IP address  is a numerical representation that uniquely identifies a specific interface on the network.
Addresses in IPv4 are 32-bits long. This allows for a maximum of 4,294,967,296 (232) unique addresses. 
Addresses in IPv6 are 128-bits, which allows for 3.4 x 1038 (2128) unique addresses.

PORT: 16bit
IP:   32bit
      -----
MAC:  48bit (Example: 00-1B-63-84-45-E6)


Classification of IP:
--------------------
Class-A: 1-127**  (1.0.0.0-126.255.255.255)   Default Subnet Mask: 255.0.0.0      Total Host: 2^24= 16,777,214 
Class-B: 128-191  (128.0.0.0-191.255.255.255) Default Subnet Mask: 255.255.0.0    Total Host: 2^16=65,534
Class-C: 192-223  (1.0.0.0-126.255.255.255)   Default Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0  Total Host: 2^8=254


Special IPs:
-----------
0.0.0.0/8       – addresses used to communicate with the local network
**127.0.0.0/8   – loopback addresses(To check whether LAN card and TCP/IP is working) 
169.254.0.0/16  – link-local addresses (APIPA)


Private IP addresses range:
---------------------------
10.0.0.0      –   10.255.255.255 
172.16.0.0    –   172.31.255.255 
192.168.0.0   –   192.168.255.255


SUBNETTING:
-----------
Subnetting is the practice of dividing a network into two or more smaller networks. 
It increases routing efficiency, enhances the security of the network and reduces the size of the broadcast domain.


Broadcast Domain
----------------
In networking, a broadcast means that we send something that everyone receives, whether they need/want it or not. 
Switches will forward broadcast traffic on all their interfaces, except the one they received the broadcast on.

There are a number of applications and protocols that use broadcast traffic. A good example is ARP (Address Resolution Protocol). 
Switches will recognize it as broadcast traffic by looking at the destination MAC address.
